# Data summary by Brian Park

## Overview of data
I used data from https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.tf641/1 which describes differences in heat tolerance for populations of different species of crustacean.

## Q1: Do certain species of crustacean have a higher tolerance to heat than other species?

*Interpreation*: The data show that the crangonyx pseudogracilis has the greatest tolerance to heat while the gammarus fossarum species has the least tolerance to heat.

## Q2: Does heat tolerance vary with the O2 concentration in the water?

*Interpreation*: The data show that for some species, such as gammarus fossarum, heat tolerance varies more under hypoxia than under hyperoxia or normoxia.

## Q3: Does the type of habitat a species lives in affect heat tolerance?

*Interpreation*: The data show that species living in standing water have greater heat tolerance than species living in running water.
